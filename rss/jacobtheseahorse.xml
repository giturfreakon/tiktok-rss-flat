I have been able to access care to help me feel really good in my body - something all trans people (and everyone) deserves.  ✨all trans people's experiences are different and I support anyone who does find the language of being born in the wrong body helpful ✨ #trans #body #pregnancy #transeducation #lgbtq </content>

    <content>Replying to @sannevdv283 we conflate pregnancy and femininity, when so many women experience their femininity in different ways and at different times in their life.  if your experience of pregnancy was the most feminine you've ever felt, that's an amazing part of your story and identity. for me and many others that isn't the case. as for me, my body isn't the wrong one and it also isn't a woman's. my body is incredibly trans and I feel so lucky to get to have made life with it. #trans #pregnancy #feminine #masculine #gender #lgbt #ally </content>

    <title>Replying to @janedo133 having babies is a blessing, but so is the choice and freedom to be able to transition. to have a body that I feel comfortable in and people around me who use the words that are right for me and for my body. everyone deserves that. </title>
